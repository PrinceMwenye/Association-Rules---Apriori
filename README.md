# Association-Rules---Apriori
Association Rules for items most frequently bought together
This is my first project to find items usually bought together in the last 2 years 2018-2020. I have pulled out 100000+ transactional data from AccPacc Database. The Python script here automatically sorts the data into nice tabular format before running the Apriori algorithm.
